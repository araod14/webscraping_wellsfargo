Her family relocated to Egypt during her childhood, and she spent much of her time in private school in Switzerland. She became proficient in the use of foreign languages and eventually mastered eleven of them. In the late 1930s, Arthur met and married Elise. They maintained several homes and eventually settled in Miami Beach, Florida.

Of Yugoslavian heritage, Mrs. Adams was strongly influenced by the Catholic Church throughout her life.Widowed at a young age in 1917, she married her second husband William Emory Adams II in 1927.  Adams was a prominent businessman in Deadwood, South Dakota, as well as its mayor for six terms during the 1920s.  The couple maintained residences in both South Dakota and California.  Their home in Deadwood now belongs to the City of Deadwood, and it is open to the public as the Historic Adams House.After William’s death in 1934, Mary continued to divide her time between the West and Midwest.  She also traveled extensively in Europe, making numerous trips to her ancestral home in Yugoslavia.During those years, she deepened her commitment to education and the performing arts and helped many young students obtain their musical training.  She also donated generously to a scholarship fund at Loyola Marymount University and to other institutions of higher learning, particularly those with programs in vocal and instrumental performance.  In addition, she shared her resources with several Roman Catholic parishes, hospitals, museums, and libraries, as well as programs for battered women and an organization serving delinquent teenage boys.  The Adams-Mastrovich Foundation was established in 1957 to sustain her philanthropic interests.After suffering a stroke in 1988, Mary entered the Marycrest Manor Home in Culver City, California, where she resided until her death in 1993."

While our philanthropic giving has benefitted many worthwhile causes and individuals, it has even more significantly shaped our own lives, giving us deeper meaning and purpose. Through the establishment of the Family Foundation, we strive to develop this charitable tradition by creating a multigenerational continuity of philanthropic giving.  As a family, they  are committed to leveraging their contributions to achieve a maximum and enduring impact on the causes they embrace. This can be achieved by using Foundation funds to elicit more funds, and by supporting causes for which the contributed funds will have far reaching financial, practical, ethical and/or communal benefits. This goal is one grounded in the Jewish tenet of tzedakah, righteous behavior. Helping one to become self-sufficient is considered the highest level of tzedakah.The objectives of the Foundation shall be guided by the following values: Gratitude: The Foundation wishes to give back to those people, organizations, and communities that serve their family, whether in the past, present, or future.Education: The Foundation believes that a basic education that teaches young men and women how to enhance their knowledge on their own is of vital importance, as it will impact their ability to live meaningful and fruitful lives.Family: The Foundation believes that strong family relationships are the most significant influence in their lives.Religion: The Foundation believes it is important that people have faith in a religion, especially one that professes Judeo-Christian values.Achievement: The Foundation  supports people and organizations that show promise of achieving their goals and impacting the world with tangible and measurable results.Creativity: The Foundation values and respects those people that think creatively and are passionate in developing solutions to serve ours mission."

The building was known as the Bethlehem Towers, a high-rise apartment community serving low- to very low-income seniors. Bethlehem Towers opened its doors in 1972 and was managed by a volunteer Board of Directors for 40 years. When the 40-year HUD loan that financed the community was paid off, the Board was approached by Reiner Communities, a firm that acquires and manages multifamily affordable housing properties, which agreed to complete an extensive renovation and extend the affordability of the project for an additional 55 years. The Board of Directors of Bethlehem Towers, Inc. saw this as a win-win situation. The housing for low-income seniors could remain in place, and proceeds from the sale could fund this new foundation dedicated to promoting an enhanced quality of life for senior adults residing in Northern California."

Following a lifetime of quiet generosity, their posthumous Foundation became active in June 2009, through their estates. Fred was a principal manager for a heating and air conditioning company and was very dedicated to his craft, his colleagues, and the many independent companies working in his industry. The Brumleys joined Plaza Presbyterian Church on March 2, 1952.  There Fred taught youth Sunday school and enjoyed preparing meals at myriad church functions.  He was very active in Men of the Church. Fred served as a Deacon and a Ruling Elder, and as the resident air and heating expert, keeping all the Church heating and air conditioning systems working and in good shape.  In addition, Fred served in the military and was a thirty-third degree Mason. He addressed most everyone as “Brother” or “Sister”.When Fred wasn’t busy at the church or office, he would take to the skies. He periodically owned several planes and he loved talking about his flying for business or pleasure. Nancy had a passion for doll houses.  Her treasure was a large colonial style doll house full of miniature furniture/settings.  But they were best known for their kind and generous spirits, philanthropy and the offer of a “hand up” to those in need.Those who knew them well have shared that there is no doubt Fred and Nancy Brumley loved each other with a deep and abiding love. Fred came home from work for lunch with “Miss Nancy” almost every day of his working life. They loved Plaza Church. They loved the Lord. And their generosity, evident during their lives, follows them still.Values StatementThe Brumleys would utter again their Lord’s truth that God’s rain falls on the just and unjust.  Without regard to merit or desert all people receive the grace of help when fallen, of light in darkness, of love when barren, of care when desolate, and the embrace of faith when broken.  Within the breast of the Brumley Foundation, beats the driven heart of mission for redemption and a brighter tomorrow.  The Foundation underscores the simple betterments listed here:Faith, Helping Others, Opportunity, Compassion, ServiceAmong other inspirations the Brumleys demonstrated was their a sense of community, family, friendship, generosity, stewardship, self-determination, equality, dignity, and care for young people."

Burgiss (originally spelled Burgess; he changed his last name as a young man, perhaps to differentiate himself from the rest of his family) was born on a farm northwest of what became the village of Greer on August 12, 1863. By the time he was sixteen, he was working as a clerk in a local tin shop, but he was soon engaged in “commercial enterprises,” including buying and selling real estate in both Greer and Greenville.In the early 1890s, Mr. Burgiss became interested in cotton mills. In 1894, he was one of a group of young men who chartered Victor Mill and, when it opened in 1895, he was named president. In 1900, he invested in and became president of Franklin Mill. Also, he was among the first peach growers in the Greer area.Local leaders “lured” him to Greenville about 1905. By 1913, he had constructed the three-story Burgiss Building at the corner of North Richardson and West Coffee Streets, where he located his real estate office, on the site currently occupied by Bank of America. His real estate transactions, however, were not limited to Greenville. Even after he moved from Greer to Greenville, he continued to own substantial amounts of land both in the town of Greer and around the countryside. After 1911, he began to invest heavily in Florida real estate, especially in land in Jacksonville and West Palm Beach. Much of his increasing wealth derived from those profitable investments. By the 1920s, W. W. Burgiss was an exceptionally wealthy man. Like many of Greenville’s progressive business leaders during the prosperous early years of the decade, he turned his attention to charity and community service. On May 2, 1925, the Greenville News announced that W. W. Burgiss had established the county’s first charitable foundation with approximately $1 million in assets, including stocks, bonds, and land in both Greer and Florida. Burgiss’s emphasis, as he made clear in his will, was to support the causes of religion, charities and education, with special attention to the assistance of the sick, helpless and needy and to the education of the underprivileged. The first major project of Burgiss Charities was covering the cost of land and construction ($300,000) of Shriners’ Hospital for Crippled Children, which opened on Rutherford Road in 1927 and was the first integrated charitable orthopedic hospital in the South. The foundation also immediately committed $10,000 to help build a mountain camp for the YWCA, which led to the establishment of Camp Burgiss Glen.In 1937, Mr. Burgiss moved to West Palm Beach, Florida and remained there until his death on February 8, 1945. The majority of his estate was left to Burgiss Charities."

He married in 1955, and he and his growing family lived in many area towns while in the oil field, finally settling in Williston. There he began his career of self-employment and started Bob’s Standard Service in 1964. He sold that business in 1975 and purchased the Amoco Bulk Plant. This venture eventually grew to two bulk plants and two convenience stores, one in Williston and one in Medicine Lake, Montana, both known to the area as Herman Oil.

Giles Hunt was born December 28, 1883, the youngest son of three children of Jeptha and Nancy Hunt, who came to the Fair Oaks area near Sutherlin in Douglas County, Oregon from Indiana in 1870. They settled on what was the old Hoskins Donation Land Claim. Reports indicate that Jeptha Hunt traveled a great deal and reportedly made his fortune in construction and gold mining in California.The three Hunt children  lived their entire lives in Douglas County, Oregon  and none of them ever married. In 1905 Giles and his brother bought the old Prairie Kilburn ranch where Gassy Creek meets Calapooya Creek in Douglas County. In addition to the three thousand acres there, the Hunt estate also included three hundred acres near Oakland which was owned by Giles’ sister. The two brothers operated the ranch as a partnership raising sheep until coyotes discouraged that, and in later years, running a few cattle. In addition to their sheep, the Hunt brothers supplemented their income by occasionally harvesting portions of the eight million board feet of timber growing on the ranch.The two brothers lived on the ranch from 1906 until their deaths. The log house they had built together 50 years earlier was destroyed by fire in 1972. Giles lived alone in a new house, more modern, but equally modest, built on the log cabin foundation.It’s interesting to note that for the last 45 years of his life, Mr. Hunt usually slept outdoors on his front porch. He was apparently advised many years before, after a tuberculosis scare, to get plenty of fresh air. At the time of his death, his bed was located on the unenclosed porch, covered only by blankets and a canvas tarp.C. Giles Hunt died on July 30, 1973."

Through the years he held various posts in other textile companies. His prominence in the field was matched by his community mindedness and led to positions of civic leadership such as chairman of the library board and a member of the Public Works Commission.In 1954, three years before he died, Mr. Symmes created a plan for his sizable estate to continue benefiting Greenville County for years to come.
